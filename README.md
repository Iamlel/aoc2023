# My Advent of Code solutions in a ruby quine that alternates between the days.

- [X] Day 1
- [X] Day 2

## How it works
aoc2023.rb is the quine.
Once you run it, it will print the answer to day 1 as well as the code to the next quine. When you run this quine, it will output the answer to day 2 as well as the code to the next quine, and so on... until we come back to day 1.

I have also included original code to the individual days before I stuffed them into the quine.

## Environment
- CPU: Intel i7-8700 (2) @ 3.192GHz 
- GPU: 00:02.0 VMware SVGA II Adapter
